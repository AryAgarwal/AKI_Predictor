# Deep Learning model for AKI Prediction on MIMIC-III
Aki-Predictor is a set of python script running deep learning model to predict Acute Kiden Injuries during the first 7 days of stay in ICU.
The proposed model was tested on MIMIC-III database.
# Introduction
Critically ill patients need specific support to preserve the function of their vital organs, for which they are treated in intensive care 
units (ICU).(1,2) Predicting the future health state of these patients is crucial, and clinicians try to foresee changes in their clinical situation
as early as possible to adjust the treatments, prevent organ failure at an early stage and avoid unfavorable outcomes. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is 
one of the most prevalent organ failures in critically ill patients, affecting approximately 40% of ICU admissions.(3-6)Acute kidney injury is 
defined as a rapid decline in renal excretory function and is classified into three stages according to the degree of increase in serum 
creatinine (SCr) and/or the decline in urine output (UO).
The goal of the present review is to investigate which internally validated clinical prediction models for early AKI diagnosis in the
heterogeneous adult ICU are currently available.

# Objective
To report on the currently available prediction models for the development of acute kidney injury in heterogeneous adult intensive care units.
